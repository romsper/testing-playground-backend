# API Playground - Backend Service for Testing purposes

## Description
This project is a backend service for managing users, products, and orders. It is built using Kotlin and Ktor, and uses Gradle for build automation.
Feel free to use this project as a playground to practice your API automation testing skills.
Moreover, you can change the code and add new features to the project if you want to practice your Kotlin skills or just to have fun.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin
- Exposed
- Gradle
- JDK 17 (`JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set to `PATH`)
- Docker or Docker Desktop (required for running `Postgres` database)

## API Documentation
## Swagger
Copy/Paste `openapi.yaml` to [Swagger Editor Online](https://editor.swagger.io/) to view the API Documentation.
Or you can use the [OpenAPI Specifications](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14394-openapi-specifications) plugin to view the API documentation in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Postman
Feel free to use the `Playground` [Postman Collection](http://postman.com/romsper-public/romsper-public) to test the API. You can import the collection into Postman and run the requests.
Or you can import the `openapi.yaml` file into `Postman` to view the API documentation and test the endpoints.


## How to Run using Docker
### Docker Compose FULL
This project uses `Docker Compose` to run the `Postgres` database and the `App`. The `docker-compose.yml` file is located in the root directory of the project.
1. Make sure you have `Docker` or `Docker Desktop` installed.
2. Open a `Terminal` and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the `Terminal` and type this command `docker compose up -d` to build and start the containers.
   (`-d` option is not required, but it is recommended to run the containers in detached mode.)
4. Wait for the containers to start. You can check the logs in the terminal.

### Docker Compose DATABASE
This project uses `Docker Compose` to run the `Postgres` database **ONLY**. The `docker-compose.yml` file is located in the root directory of the project.
1. Make sure you have `Docker` or `Docker Desktop` installed.
2. Open a `Terminal` and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the `Terminal` and type this command `docker compose -f docker-compose-database.yml up -d` to build and start the `Postgres` container.
   (`-d` option is not required, but it is recommended to run the container in detached mode.)

## How to Run using IntelliJ IDEA
### *nix
This project has been tested on `Linux` and `MacOS` operating systems. The steps below should work on both, but there may be some differences in the installation process.
1. Install a fresh instance of `Docker Desktop`.
2. Download the `JDK 17 Corretto` installer from the Amazon website.
3. Install/Update `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition` to the latest version.
4. Open the `IDEA` project (check in the settings that `Gradle` is using the correct `JDK` version).
5. IDEA automatically downloads all `dependencies`.
6. Follow the **Docker Compose DATABASE** section to run the `Postgres` database.
7. Go to the `src/main/kotlin` directory and open the `Application.kt` file.
8. Right-click on the `main` function and select `Run 'ApplicationKt'` or use the `play` button in the top right corner of the IDE.

### Windows
This project has been tested on `Windows` operating system. The steps below should work on Windows, but there may be some differences in the installation process.
1. Install a fresh instance of `Docker Desktop`.
2. The Docker installer offered to install WSL and run through it instead of Hyper-V (a pleasant surprise ❤️).
3. Install/Update `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition` to the latest version.
4. Download the `JDK 17 Corretto` installer from the Amazon website.
5. Verify the system and user `PATH` variables (one was incorrect, so I updated it manually).
6. Reboot the computer to apply the new `PATH`.
7. Open the `IDEA` project (check in the settings that `Gradle` is using the correct `JDK` version).
8. IDEA automatically downloads all `dependencies`.
9. Open a new type of `Terminal` in IDEA via right-clicking on the terminal tab (see screenshot).
   (This terminal is some kind of illegitimate child of Linux and Windows...)
10. Follow the **Docker Compose DATABASE** section to run the `Postgres` database.
11. Go to the `src/main/kotlin` directory and open the `Application.kt` file.
12. Right-click on the `main` function and select `Run 'ApplicationKt'` or use the `play` button in the top right corner of the IDE.

### Configuration
The application configuration is located in the `src/main/resources/application.conf` file. You can change the database connection settings, server port, and other parameters there.

## Logs
Logs are written to the `logs` directory in the root of the project. You can change the logging configuration in the `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file.
